    time
    blocks {
      id
      type
      ... on ParagraphBlock {
        data {
          text
        }
      }
      ... on HeaderBlock {
        data {
          text
          level
        }
      }
      ... on ListBlock {
        data {
          style
          items
        }
      }
    }
